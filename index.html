<h1>Autism Spectrum Disorder</h1>
Mayo Clinic.

<h2>Overview</h2>
Autism spectrum disorder is a condition related to brain development that affects how people see 
others and socialize with them. This causes problems in communication and getting along with 
others socially. The condition also includes limited and repeated patterns of behavior. The term 
"spectrum" in autism spectrum disorder refers to the wide range of symptoms and the severity of 
these symptoms.

Autism spectrum disorder includes conditions that were once thought to be separate â€” autism, 
Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and a form of widespread developmental 
disorder that isn't specified.

Autism spectrum disorder begins in early childhood. Over time, it can cause difficulty 
functioning in society. For example, people with autism spectrum disorder may have problems 
being social or when in school or at work. Often children show symptoms of autism within the 
first year of life. A small number of children with the condition appear to develop as 
expected in the first year. Then between 18 and 24 months of age, they may lose some skills 
and develop autism symptoms.

There is no cure for autism spectrum disorder. But getting treatment early, during the 
preschool years, can make a big difference in the lives of many children with the condition.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
Some children show signs of autism spectrum disorder in early infancy, such as less eye contact, 
not responding to their names or not being interested in caregivers. Other children may not 
develop as expected for the first few months or years of life. Then they suddenly become 
withdrawn or aggressive or lose the language skills they had before. Signs usually are seen by 
ages 2 to 3 years old.

Some people in the mild range on the autism spectrum may have more symptoms that aren't noticed 
early on. They may not be diagnosed until middle to late childhood, when there is a greater need 
to communicate and be social. Sometimes a diagnosis is made for the first time in adulthood, 
though symptoms were likely present during childhood.

Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior that 
depends on whether symptoms are mild, moderate or severe.

Some children with autism spectrum disorder have trouble learning, and some have signs of lower 
than usual intelligence. Other children with the condition have usual to high intelligence. 
These children learn quickly but have trouble communicating, applying what they know in everyday 
life and adjusting to social situations.

Because each child can have a unique mix of symptoms, sometimes it can be hard to tell how severe 
the condition is. It's generally based on how severe the symptoms are and how much those symptoms 
affect a child being able to function.

Below are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder.

<h3>Social communication and interaction</h3>
People with autism spectrum disorder may have problems getting along with others and 
communicating. They may have a mix of these and other symptoms:

	- Don't respond to their name, or they don't seem to hear at times.
	- Don't want to be cuddled or held and prefer to play alone, retreating into their own worlds.
	- Have poor eye contact and have no expression on their faces.
	- Don't speak or have delayed speech or lose the ability to say words or sentences as they 
	  could before.
	- Can't start a conversation or keep one going, or only start one to make requests or label 
	  items.
	- Speak with an unusual tone or rhythm and may use a singsong voice or robotlike speech.
	- Repeat words or phrases word for word but don't know how to use them.
	- Don't seem to understand simple questions or directions.
	- Don't show emotions or feelings and don't seem to be aware of how others feel.
	- Don't point at or bring objects to share interest.
	- Are passive, aggressive or disruptive when interacting with others.
	- Have a hard time figuring out what it means when people have different looks on their faces, 
	  position their bodies differently or speak in different tones of voice.

<h3>Patterns of behavior</h3>
People with autism spectrum disorder may have limited, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests 
or activities, including a mix of these and other signs:

	- Make the same movement over and over again, such as rocking, spinning or hand-flapping.
	- Do activities where they could hurt themselves, such as biting or head-banging.
	- Create specific routines or rituals and become upset at even small changes.
	- Aren't coordinated and may be clumsy, or they move in patterns that aren't usual, such as 
	  walking on toes.
	- Have unusual, stiff or exaggerated body language.
	- Are fascinated by details of an object, such as the spinning wheels of a toy car, but they 
	  don't know what the object is for or how it works.
	- Are sensitive to light, sound or touch but may not be affected by pain or temperature.
	- Don't mimic others or take part in make-believe play.
	- Fixate on an object or activity with unusual intensity or focus.
	- Prefer specific foods, such as eating only a few foods or not wanting to eat foods with 
	  certain textures.

As they get older, some children with autism spectrum disorder interact more with others and 
show fewer disturbances in behavior. Some, usually those with the least severe problems, 
eventually may lead typical or nearly typical lives. But others continue to have trouble with 
language or social skills. And the teenage years can bring more behavioral and emotional challenges.

<h3>When to see a doctor</h3>
Babies develop at their own pace, and many don't follow exact timelines found in some parenting 
books. But children with autism spectrum disorder usually show some signs of delayed development 
before they're 3 years old. Signs of autism spectrum disorder often appear early in development 
when there are obvious delays in language skills and social interactions.

If you're concerned about your child's development or think that your child may have autism 
spectrum disorder, talk with a healthcare professional about your concerns. Your healthcare 
professional may recommend developmental tests to figure out if your child has delays in 
learning, thinking, language or social skills that point to autism spectrum disorder or 
another type of developmental condition.

<h2>Understanding autism: The path to diagnosis, awareness and support</h2>
Diagnosing a person with autism spectrum disorder can be challenging. It's a medical condition 
that no blood test, brain scan or objective test can pinpoint. And because of each person's 
distinctive pattern of symptoms, it can be hard to determine its severity.

As people gain familiarity with autism, however, they are becoming more open to discussing 
the diagnosis and seeking treatment. Society is also becoming more motivated to learn about 
neurodivergent conditions, including autism.

<h3>What is autism spectrum disorder?</h3>
Autism spectrum disorder is a condition related to brain development that affects how a 
person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social interaction and 
communication. It includes conditions that previously were considered separate, including 
autism, Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and an unspecified form of 
pervasive developmental disorder.

Autism affects children and adults in three areas: communication, social interaction and 
behaviors. Children with autism spectrum disorder may struggle with recognizing their 
emotions and may feel them more intensely. Regulating their anger and frustration can be 
difficult and lead to intense bursts of emotions. Children with autism also have higher 
rates of anxiety and depression.

Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a distinctive pattern of behavior 
and level of severity. A healthcare professional will generally describe the severity of the 
condition based on the person's level of impairments and how those affect their ability to 
function.

A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have problems with social interaction 
and communication skills, including any of these signs:
	- Can't start a conversation, keep one going or can only start one to make requests 
      or label items.
	- Doesn't appear to understand simple questions or directions.
	- Doesn't express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others' feelings.
	- Doesn't speak or has delayed speech.
	- Fails to respond to their name or appears not to hear you sometimes.
	- Has difficulty recognizing nonverbal cues, such as interpreting other people's facial 
	  expressions, body postures or tone of voice.
	- Has poor eye contact and lacks facial expression.
	- Inappropriately approaches a social interaction by being passive, aggressive or disruptive.
	- Prefers playing alone.
	- Repeats words or phrases verbatim but doesn't understand how to use them.
	
<h3>Awareness of autism behaviors</h3>
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the latest research from 2023 
shows that 1 in 36 children was diagnosed with autism. This is an increase from 1 in 44 children 
just two years ago.

Children tend to become more aware of their diagnosis around puberty. Kids recognize their 
differences from their peers and notice their struggle to fit in. They might notice they're 
not being invited to participate in certain activities or being accepted in the same way as 
many of their peers. Social interactions become more crucial for young people in middle and 
high school, which can be stressful for someone on the autism spectrum.

Parents may notice symptoms early on when they see how their child's behaviors, communication 
and social interactions differ from their peer group. It can be challenging for parents to 
accept that their child is different from other children. Parents may feel guilty and 
responsible, even though this developmental condition has no known cause.

<h3>Living with autism spectrum disorder</h3>
As the number of people living with autism spectrum disorder increases, it's critical to seek out 
educational opportunities that can help with understanding autism spectrum disorder. What are the 
strengths and disadvantages of the child? How can that knowledge be used to strengthen the skills 
of a child with autism? Answering these questions can help identify specific interventions to 
teach skills relevant to the child.

For example, if a child struggles with regulating emotions, this can be addressed through treatment 
to help them gain more control over their emotions and behaviors.

No cure exists for autism spectrum disorder, and there's no one-size-fits-all treatment. The goal 
of treatment is to maximize your child's ability to function by reducing their autism spectrum 
disorder symptoms and supporting their development and learning. Early intervention during the 
preschool years is key.

<h4>Treatment options may include:</h4>
	- Behavior and communication therapies
	- Educational therapies
	- Family therapies
	- Medications

When you have a child or loved one with autism, the chance of them having anxiety or depression 
is increased. Evaluating and treating these symptoms can improve their level of functioning and 
their overall mental health.

One of the most critical things parents, friends or classmates of someone diagnosed with autism 
spectrum disorder can do is educate yourself about it while recognizing their strengths.

You can develop increased compassion for your loved ones, classmates, friends and colleagues by 
recognizing and understanding more about the condition. While you can't eliminate a child's autism 
or wait for them to outgrow it, you can minimize some of its symptoms and improve quality of life.
